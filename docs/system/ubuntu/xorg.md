# XORG Config handling issues

## sudo rm /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/*

Sometimes we go to far and we accidentally remove what we shouldn't. With these steps, you'll be able to recover you Ubuntu machine easily if you experience:

1. The removal of bespoken folder (or its associates)
2. Your keyboard and mouse get stuck (not guaranteed)

First of all, you need to start your machine in safe mode and with networking. To do that, press `ESC` a few times when your machine is starting.

You should get a pop-up with the option networking.
